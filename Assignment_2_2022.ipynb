    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment_2_2022_uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) [Please note that if you have to pull from the upstream repo you will need to change the name back first and add your uid after the pull again]\n",

    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. Any variation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them. You can change these to Markdown cells where necessary (e.g. you may need to include some figures in your answer).\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* Your code answers will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Your written answers will be marked on the **correctness**, **depth** and **clarity** of your written answers. If your marker cannot understand your answer, marks may be deducted\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",
