## Declaration
  I declare that everything that I have submitted in this assignment is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

In the fields below, replace 'N/A' with appropriate words, in case this applies
to you.  'N/A' stands for 'Not Applicable', which implies that this does not
apply to you (this is the default).  IF this does not apply to you, then leave the 'N/A' as is.

Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary

### Collaboration:
If you have discussed any questions or solutions with other students of the course (COMP2420 & COMP6420), you must note this here. They must also note it in their solution.
